GUI is used through the files app on your PC and is a more overlook of directories and files within your system. Comparatively, CLI uses the command prompt within your system to manipulate and jump to different directories, files, or programs on your system. GUI is used through mouse functions while the CLI can use different mouse functions through text commands. CLI is much faster than GUI with its use its ability to do many functions through one program rather than sifting through many directories for what you need. GUI has the benefit of being able to overlook everything you have to work with. CLIs give you more control over what you are working with as well as the OS. CLI can perform more tasks apart from looking at files. CLI vs GUI boils down to manipulation compared to a general overview.
